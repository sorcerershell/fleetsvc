# ES6 example project

This is an example project that targets node 8.0.0 and up. The project
is a simple express server with a REST API that demonstrates the basic
functionalities of objection like models, relations, eager loading,
graph inserts, graph upserts etc.

# Install and run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Vincit/objection.js.git objection
cd objection/examples/express-es6
npm install
npm start
```

`client.js` file contains a bunch example requests and is a good place
to start playing with the REST API.

```sh
node client.js
```
